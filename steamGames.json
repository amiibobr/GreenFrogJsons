Her adventure is halted when all her fuel, the Time Pieces, is lost and scattered across a nearby planet. Hat Kid must now jump, fight and stitch new hats to make her way into every nook and cranny of this new world in order to restore her fuel and resume her journey. On her way, she'll bump into the menacing Mafia of Cooks, the goofy birds of Dead Bird Studio, the spooky shadows of Subcon Forest, and more!\n <h2 class=\"bb_tag\">\n  Murder on a train! Parades! Trespassing in a movie studio?\n </h2>\n Every mission in A Hat in Time is unique! At one moment you'll be solving the\n <strong>\n  Murder on the Owl Express\n </strong>\n by finding clues and interrogating the locals, the next moment you'll be the band marshal in\n <strong>\n  The Big Parade\n </strong>\n , or sneaking through the bird-run\n <strong>\n  Dead Bird Studio\n </strong>\n !\n <br/>\n <br/>\n <img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/253230/extras/alpine.jpg?t=1688042605\"/>\n <h2 class=\"bb_tag\">\n  Small child, giant worlds\n </h2>\n Jump freely around in 5 massive worlds with new adventures to discover around every corner! Just like any child, Hat Kid loves to climb and explore, no mountain is too big for her sense of adventure. She can do multiple jump moves, as well as climb walls, and swing over gaps!\n <h2 class=\"bb_tag\">\n  Cute hats, magical yarn and snappy badges\n </h2>\n By finding and collecting rare magical yarn, Hat Kid can stitch new cute hats with a variety of abilities, including a witch hat that allows her to cook explosive concoctions, and a wooden ghost mask that allows her to peek into other dimensions. Hats can become even more powerful, by attaching badges that are found, sold and traded by the locals!\n <h2 class=\"bb_tag\">\n  Community-funded, community-focused\n </h2>\n A Hat in Time was successfully funded on Kickstarter, reaching nearly 10 times its goal! In order to celebrate our community, A Hat in Time is releasing with full modding and Steam Workshop support, an in-game screenshot mode, and more!\n</div>\n",

Along with timed hits, combat features multi-character combo attacks, boosting, and a strategic \"locks\" system offering options to play with different damage types in order to hinder enemies while they are channeling powerful attacks or spells, all in an immersive take on the genre; no random encounters, no transitions to separate battlefields, and no grinding.\n <br/>\n <br/>\n <img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1244090/extras/steam-feature-traversal-flip.png?t=1726755224\"/>\n <br/>\n Swim, climb, vault, jump off or hoist up ledges as you traverse seamlessly through the world with a navigation system based on platformer expertise that breaks free from the classic bound-to-the-grid tileset movement.\n <br/>\n <br/>\n <img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1244090/extras/steam-feature-lighting.png?t=1726755224\"/>\n <br/>\n Our custom-made render pipeline allows the creation of a breathtaking world coming to life by pushing the limits of 2D pixel-art games.\n <br/>\n <br/>\n <img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1244090/extras/steam-feature-story-rich-adventure.png?t=1726755224\"/>\n <br/>\n Dozens of original characters and story arcs will take you on a captivating journey. Sometimes epic, sometimes silly, and other times emotional, Sea of Stars does its RPG duty of exploring classic themes of adventure and friendship, while also being chock-full of the unexpected twists and events you’d expect from a Sabotage production.\n <br/>\n <br/>\n <img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1244090/extras/steam-feature-sabotage-touch.png?t=1726755224\"/>\n <br/>\n There are many ways to hang out in the world of Sea of Stars if you feel the need for a change of pace in your adventures. Sailing, cooking, fishing, stopping by a tavern to listen to a song or play the infamous tabletop game known as \"Wheels\".....every system has been designed to deliver an experience that pays respect to retro classics, while rethinking in some areas to offer a smooth and modernized experience.\n</div>\n",

        "desc": "<div class=\"game_area_description\" id=\"game_area_description\">\n <h2>\n  About This Game\n </h2>\n Pacific Drive is a first-person driving survival game with your car as your only companion. Navigate a surreal reimagining of the Pacific Northwest, and face supernatural dangers as you venture into the Olympic Exclusion Zone. Each excursion into the wilderness brings unique and strange challenges as you restore and upgrade your car from an abandoned garage that acts as your home base. Gather precious resources and investigate what’s been left behind in the Zone; unravel a long-forgotten mystery while learning exactly what it takes to survive in this unpredictable, hostile environment.\n <h2 class=\"bb_tag\">\n  Features\n </h2>\n <ul class=\"bb_ul\">\n  <li>\n   Outrun the storm while facing strange perils in a world that shifts with every journey into the Zone\n   <br/>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   Your car, your way – scavenge resources to craft new equipment and configure your wagon how you want. Experiment with different mods and car parts to navigate a treacherous landscape, and look good doing it\n   <br/>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   Unravel the mystery of the Olympic Exclusion Zone, an abandoned research site in an anomaly-filled version of the Pacific Northwest\n   <br/>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   Original score by Wilbert Roget, II and featuring 20+ licensed songs\n  </li>\n </ul>\n <br/>\n <strong>\n  DRIVE TO SURVIVE\n </strong>\n <br/>\n <img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1458140/extras/DriveToSurvive2.jpg?t=1728639586\"/>\n <br/>\n It’s you and your station wagon against an unforgiving, vicious world. It’ll take more than a fresh set of tires to keep you alive, on and off the road. Your faithful wagon can be upgraded and reinforced to protect you, but the car is going to take a beating. Keep your gas tank filled and your panels intact to withstand the radiation permeating the Zone. You’ll be pushed to your limit - making repairs on the fly, scavenging materials wherever you can, and adapting your rolling fortress to tackle the many life-threatening dangers that lurk in the shadows.\n <br/>\n <br/>\n <strong>\n  INVESTIGATE THE ZONE\n </strong>\n <br/>\n <img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1458140/extras/Investigatethezone123.png?t=1728639586\"/>\n <br/>\n The experimental leftovers of the secretive ARDA organization remain scattered across the Zone, and finding answers won’t be easy. Everywhere you look you’ll find anomalies, surreal forces of a twisted nature that make your journey more difficult... or more interesting. Silhouettes in the dark, rolling piles of scrap metal, and towering pillars of earth - each trip is packed with otherworldly hazards. As terrifying as those may be, nothing compares to the overwhelming power of a Zone Storm. Stomp on the gas and outrun it if you can - these rolling maelstroms rend the landscape and obliterate anything that sticks around too long. Don’t let that be you.\n <br/>\n <br/>\n <strong>\n  REPEAT\n </strong>\n <br/>\n <img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1458140/extras/Repeat2.png?t=1728639586\"/>\n <br/>\n Check the map, pack some gear for the trip, and hit the road. Gather resources and collect data as you go, there’s all sorts of useful stuff inside the walls of the Zone. Make it back safely and use the contents of your trunk to improve your car and garage. Every time you venture out, new trials await: bizarre weather, unforgiving landscapes, and experimental remnants. The golden rule in the Zone is ‘nothing ventured, nothing gained’ — some materials can only be found in the most dangerous places. Be smart out there, and don’t waste time — it’s going to be a long haul.\n</div>\n",

This will require some dirty work and shady clientele, but you have no other choice, right? When the big boss calls once again, bring a bucket and a mop cause you will really need them. Are you up for the challenge?\n <br/>\n <br/>\n <img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1040200/extras/CSC_SteamPage_01.gif?t=1729281414\"/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n You need nerves of steel to clean crime scenes left behind by major and minor criminals. You may not have money for your daughter’s hospital stays, but what you do have is a very particular set of skills. With the help of an entire arsenal of equipment, you will clean blood, pack up bodies, and remove any odor. All this under the pressure of a ticking clock and police breathing down your neck.\n <br/>\n <br/>\n <img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1040200/extras/CSC_GIF.gif?t=1729281414\"/>\n <h2 class=\"bb_tag\">\n  Key Features:\n </h2>\n <ul class=\"bb_ul\">\n  <li>\n   <strong>\n    Deep Clean\n   </strong>\n   - Grab your trusty mop and sponge. They will be handy for the majority of the missions. When the mess becomes too much, whip out the powerwasher and clean the outside spaces deeply. Or when the smell is a bit too strong, you have more than just an odor eliminator.\n   <br/>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   <strong>\n    Arm’s Race\n   </strong>\n   - Sometimes, the equipment you have is not enough and needs an extra oomph. If your lamps or flashlights are not strong enough, get new ones! If there is too much blood outside, get a different set of power washer nozzles! So, before every mission, check the perks available and boost your cleaning arsenal. If you can make your job easier... why not take that opportunity?\n   <br/>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   <strong>\n    Deep Pockets\n   </strong>\n   - Make money in any way you can! Mobsters are known for being generous, but sometimes that’s not enough. And certain objects may be too tempting. Who is going to miss this expensive watch? The owner’s already dead.\n   <br/>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   <strong>\n    It’s about Family\n   </strong>\n   - With all the gruesome things you will see and do on every job, you must not forget that you are doing this for her. The life of a single father has its challenges, and you need to overcome them all.\n  </li>\n </ul>\n <br/>\n <img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1040200/extras/CSC_SteamPage_03.gif?t=1729281414\"/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n So, are you the bad guy? You’re simply a man with the brains and brawn to take fate into his own hands.  You’re the man of the hour, so clean, keep your head down and get that cash.\n</div>\n",

Instilling joy and wonder, they provide a unique bond that enables you to utilize their skills for traversing the planet and solving environmental challenges. Once peaceful creatures, they now succumb to an unknown infection driving them to behave aggressively, which makes your mission to save them an urgent necessity.\n <h2 class=\"bb_tag\">\n  Exploration-driven Gameplay\n </h2>\n The gameplay encourages curiosity-driven exploration of its distinct ecosystems—such as the colorful Nari jungle or mysterious Mâruba swamp—creating an interconnected world. With non-aggressive combat mechanics designed for healing rather than defeating and indigenous Flute melodies that you play to tame creatures, the game further highlights the creature-saver nature of the experience.\n <br/>\n <br/>\n <img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2304440/extras/AVA_GIF_03_616x260.gif?t=1727879278\"/>\n <h2 class=\"bb_tag\">\n  Meaningful Narrative\n </h2>\n Step into the shoes of Vic, a 22-year-old nature adventurer as she navigates through the immersive expedition alongside Tabitha, a composed and astute researcher.

The game's narrative, co-created by Rhianna Pratchett, is a journey of wonder and mystery but also discovery, leading to the revelation of the planet's captivating secrets.\n <br/>\n <br/>\n <img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2304440/extras/AVA_GIF_01_616x260.gif?t=1727879278\"/>\n <h2 class=\"bb_tag\">\n  Saving Through Understanding\n </h2>\n Creatures of Ava is a game featuring a dense, populated world of rich ecosystems filled with creatures that play a vital role in the planet’s natural balance.

        "desc": "<div class=\"game_area_description\" id=\"game_area_description\">\n <h2>\n  About This Game\n </h2>\n As a man or woman stranded naked, freezing and starving on the shores of a mysterious island called ARK, you must hunt, harvest resources, craft items, grow crops, research technologies, and build shelters to withstand the elements. Use your cunning and resources to kill or tame &amp; breed the leviathan dinosaurs and other primeval creatures roaming the land, and team up with or prey on hundreds of other players to survive, dominate... and escape!\n <br/>\n <br/>\n <img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/346110/extras/TameTrainBreedRide.png?t=1709879597\"/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n Dinosaurs, Creatures, &amp; Breeding! -- over 100+ creatures can be tamed using a challenging capture-&amp;-affinity process, involving weakening a feral creature to knock it unconscious, and then nursing it back to health with appropriate food. Once tamed, you can issue commands to your tames, which it may follow depending on how well you’ve tamed and trained it. Tames, which can continue to level-up and consume food, can also carry Inventory and Equipment such as Armor, carry prey back to your settlement depending on their strength, and larger tames can be ridden and directly controlled! Fly a Pterodactyl over the snow-capped mountains, lift allies over enemy walls, race through the jungle with a pack of Raptors, tromp through an enemy base along a gigantic brontosaurus, or chase down prey on the back of a raging T-Rex! Take part in a dynamic ecosystem life-cycle with its own predator &amp; prey hierarchies, where you are just one creature among many species struggling for dominance and survival. Tames can also be mated with the opposite gender, to selectively breed successive generations using a trait system based on recombinant genetic inheritance. This process includes both egg-based incubation and mammalian gestation lifecycles! Or put more simply, raise babies!\n <br/>\n <br/>\n <img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/346110/extras/FoodWaterTemp.png?t=1709879597\"/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n You must eat and drink to survive, with different kinds of plants &amp; meat having different nutritional properties, including human meat. Ensuring a supply of fresh water to your home and inventory is a pressing concern. All physical actions come at a cost of food and water, long-distance travel is fraught with subsistence peril! Inventory weight makes you move slower, and the day/night cycle along with randomized weather patterns add another layer of challenge by altering the temperature of the environment, causing you to hunger or thirst more quickly. Build a fire or shelter, and craft a large variety of customizable clothing &amp; armors, to help protect yourself against locational damage &amp; extreme temperatures using the dynamic indoor/outdoor insulation calculation system!\n <br/>\n <br/>\n <img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/346110/extras/HarvestBuildPaint.png?t=1709879597\"/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n By chopping down forests full of trees and mining metal and other precious resources, you can craft the parts to build massive multi-leveled structures composed of complex snap-linked parts, including ramps, beams, pillars, windows, doors, gates, remote gates, trapdoors, water pipes, faucets, generators, wires and all manner of electrical devices, and ladders among many other types. Structures have a load system to fall apart if enough support has been destroyed, so reinforcing your buildings is important. All structures and items can be painted to customize the look of your home, as well as placing dynamically per-pixel paintable signs, textual billboards, and other decorative objects. Shelter reduces the extremes of weather and provides security for yourself and your stash! Weapons, clothing &amp; armor gear can also be painted to express your own visual style.\n <br/>\n <br/>\n <img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/346110/extras/PlantFarmGrow.png?t=1709879597\"/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n Pick seeds from the wild vegetation around you, plant them in plots that you lay down, water them and nurture them with fertilizer (everything poops after consuming calories, which can then be composted, and some fertilizer is better than others). Tend to your crops and they will grow to produce delicious and rare fruits, which can also be used to cook a plethora of logical recipes and make useful tonics! Explore to find the rarest of plant seeds that have the most powerful properties! Vegetarians &amp; vegans can flourish, and it will be possible to master and conquer the ARK in a non-violent manner!\n <br/>\n <br/>\n <img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/346110/extras/Summon.png?t=1709879597\"/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n By bringing sufficient rare sacrificial items to special Summon locations, you can capture the attention of the one of the ARK’s god-like mythical creatures, who will arrive for battle. These gargantuan monstrosities provide an end-game goal for the most experienced groups of players and their armies of tames, and will yield extremely valuable progression items if they are defeated.\n <br/>\n <br/>\n <img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/346110/extras/Tribes.png?t=1709879597\"/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n Create a Tribe and add your friends to it, and all your tames can be commanded by and allied to anyone in your Tribe. Your Tribe will also be able to respawn at any of your home spawn points. Promote members to Tribe Admins to reduce the burden of management. Distribute key items and pass-codes to provide access your shared village!\n <br/>\n <br/>\n <img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/346110/extras/RPG.png?t=1709879597\"/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n All items are crafted from Blueprints that have variable statistics and qualities, and require corresponding resources. More remote and harsh locales across the ARK tend to have better resources, including the tallest mountains, darkest caves, and depths of the ocean! Level-Up your player character by gaining experience through performance actions, Level-Up your tames, and learn new \"Engrams\" to be able to craft Items from memory without the use of blueprints, even if you die! Customize the underlying physical look of your character with hair, eye, and skin tones, along with an array of body proportion modifiers. As you explore the vast ARK, you'll find clues left by other Survivors who have made the ARK their home in ages past, in the form of collectible detailed 3D \"Explorer Notes\". By uncovering all of these, you can begin to piece together the true nature of the ARK, and discover its purpose!\n <br/>\n <br/>\n <img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/346110/extras/HardcoreMechanics.png?t=1709879597\"/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n Everything you craft has durability and will wear-out from extended use if not repaired, and when you leave the game, your character remains sleeping in the persistent world. Your inventory physically exists in boxes or on your character in the world. Everything can be looted &amp; stolen, so to achieve security you must build-up, team-up, or have tames to guard your stash. Death is permanent, and you can even knock out, capture, and force-feed other players to use them for your own purposes, such as extracting their blood to for transfusions, harvesting their fecal matter to use as fertilizer, or using them as food for your carnivorous tames!\n <br/>\n <br/>\n <img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/346110/extras/ExploreAndDiscover.png?t=1709879597\"/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n The mysterious ARK is a formidable and imposing environment, composed of many natural and unnatural structures, above-ground, below-ground, and underwater. By fully exploring its secrets, you’ll find the most exotic procedurally randomized creatures and rare blueprints. Also to be found are Explorer Notes that are dynamically updated into the game, written by previous human denizens of the ARK from across the millennia, creatively detailing the creatures and backstory of the ARK and its creatures. Fully develop your in-game ARK-map through exploration, write custom points of interest onto it, and craft a Compass or GPS coordinates to aid exploring with other players, whom you can communicate with via proximity text &amp; voice chat, or long-distance radio. Construct &amp; draw in-game signs for other players to help them or lead them astray...  And yet.. how do you ultimately challenge the Creators and Conquer the ARK? A definitive end-game is planned.\n <br/>\n <br/>\n <img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/346110/extras/LargeWorld.png?t=1709879597\"/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n On the 100+ player servers, your character, everything you built, and your tames, stay in-game even when you leave. You can even physically travel your character and items between the network of ARK's by accessing the Obelisks and uploading (or downloading) your data from the Steam Economy! A galaxy of ARKs, each slightly different than the previous, to leave your mark on and conquer, one at a time -- special official ARKs will be unveiled on the World-map for limited times in singular themed events with corresponding limited-run items! Furthermore, you can now design or randomize your own unique 'Procedurally Generated ARKs', for infinite replayability and endless surprises.\n <br/>\n <br/>\n <img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/346110/extras/RobustSteamWorkshop.png?t=1709879597\"/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n You can play single-player local games, and bring your character and items between unofficial player-hosted servers, back and forth from singleplayer to multiplayer.

As one of the last remnants of humanity, you’ll set out alone or alongside up to two other players to face down hordes of deadly enemies and epic bosses, and try to carve a foothold, rebuild, and then retake what was lost.\n <br/>\n <br/>\n <strong>\n  A REMNANT OF MANKIND\n </strong>\n <br/>\n The world has been thrown into chaos by an ancient evil from another dimension. Humanity is struggling to survive, but they possess the technology to open portals to other realms and alternate realities. They must travel through these portals to uncover the mystery of where the evil came from, scavenge resources to stay alive, and fight back to carve out a foothold for mankind to rebuild...\n <br/>\n <br/>\n <strong>\n  ENDLESS FANTASTIC REALMS AWAIT\n </strong>\n <br/>\n Explore dynamically-generated worlds that change each time you play through them, creating new maps, enemy encounters, quest opportunities, and in-world events. Each of the game’s four unique worlds is filled with monstrous denizens and environments that will provide fresh challenges with each playthrough. Adapt and explore… or die trying.\n <br/>\n <br/>\n <strong>\n  SCAVENGE. UPGRADE. SPECIALIZE.\n </strong>\n <br/>\n Overcome tough-as-nails enemies and epic bosses throughout hostile environments to earn experience, valuable loot and upgrade materials you can use to build a wicked arsenal of weapons, armor, and modifications to approach each encounter dozens of unique ways.\n <br/>\n <br/>\n <strong>\n  STRENGTH IN NUMBERS.\n </strong>\n <br/>\n Invading other worlds to seek an end to the Root is dangerous and survival is far from guaranteed. Team up with up to two other players to increase your chances of survival. Teamwork is necessary to make it through the game’s toughest challenges… and unlock its greatest rewards.\n</div>\n",

One epic journey across Japan!\n <br/>\n <br/>\n Brought to you by Zero Escape series creator Kotaro Uchikoshi, and Kazutaka Kodaka, mastermind behind the Danganronpa games. With twists and turns aplenty, this mysterious, captivating tale of friendship and adversity will have you hooked from the get go.\n <br/>\n <br/>\n Dive into this easy to pick up fusion of puzzle platforming and choice-driven story adventure, and surround yourself with a cast of charming, quirky characters as you set off on an unforgettable trip!\n <br/>\n <br/>\n In an elementary school in Tokyo, a group of oddball kids from across the country have banded together as the \"Go-Getters Club.\" Reycho and the rest of the Go-Getters are, to say the least, a little different to the rest of their classmates.\n <br/>\n <br/>\n One summer's day the group is riding the bus on a school trip when disaster strikes. They wake up to find themselves trapped in a rusted, long-abandoned underwater theme park. As they struggle to get their bearings, a sinister clown appears out of the blue and informs the Go-Getters that they'll be playing a \"Game of Fate\"—pitting their lives against one another in a desperate struggle for survival!\n <br/>\n <br/>\n Bewildered and confused, prospects look bleak for Reycho and the gang, but when all hope seems lost, out of nowhere, strange powers start to awaken in the daring Go-Getters.\n <br/>\n <br/>\n What in the world could happen next!?\n</div>\n",

One night they encounter a pair of otherworldly creatures, Porcus and Purrsula, and are whisked away to a mysterious place known as Draconia - a legendary land full of monsters to befriend and treasures just waiting to be discovered. The adventure Erik and Mia have always dreamed of is finally underway!\n <h2 class=\"bb_tag\">\n  ＜Setting＞\n </h2>\n DRAGON QUEST TREASURES is all about the thrill of adventure—and that means treasure hunting!\n <br/>\n <br/>\n The adventure takes place in Draconia, a land that's home to countless pieces of precious loot.\n <br/>\n Join Erik and Mia as they search for the legendary Dragonstones, picking up as much treasure as they can along the way!\n <h2 class=\"bb_tag\">\n  ＜Base＞\n </h2>\n With the threat of rival treasure-hunting crews looming large, Erik and Mia form a gang of their own and snag a base of operations. Every piece of loot they acquire adds to the total value of their treasure vault. When this value hits a certain point, their gang will go up a rank, unlocking new treasure-hunting abilities and the option to add to the base's amenities.\n <h2 class=\"bb_tag\">\n  ＜Rival Gang＞\n </h2>\n Treasure hunting gangs have been known to flock from far and wide in the hope of striking it rich. “Rival Gangs” will stop at nothing to get their hands on Erik and Mia’s treasure – from attacking out in the field to launching a raid on base.\n <h2 class=\"bb_tag\">\n  &lt;Field＞\n </h2>\n Draconia was formed from the bodies of two enormous Golden Dragons. Over the rocky eons their rocky remains have eroded away to leave six floating islands. Erik and Mia can scout five very different biomes in their hunt for treasure, from volcanic mountains and bone-dry deserts to frozen wastelands. Each island in inhabited by various types of monsters. Using the powers of the “Dragon Daggers”, Erik and Mia can recruit monsters to join their gang. Each monster has a special ability called a 'Forte', allowing them to soar through the air or dive into the ground to bypass obstacles enroute to the loot. By working together with their well-manner monster, Erik and Mia hunt for treasures buried across the lands of Draconia!\n <br/>\n <br/>\n *Please thoroughly review the product content and bonuses before purchasing, as this product has a “standard edition” and a “digital deluxe edition”.\n</div>\n",

It is an expanded re-imagining of the critically acclaimed, award winning indie game The Stanley Parable from 2013.\n </strong>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n When a simple-minded individual named Stanley discovers that the co-workers in his office have mysteriously vanished, he sets off to find answers.\n <br/>\n <br/>\n You will play as Stanley, and you will not play as Stanley. You will make a choice, and you will have your choices taken from you. The game will end, the game will never end. Contradiction follows contradiction, the rules of how games should work are broken, then broken again. You are not here to win. The Stanley Parable is a game that plays you.\n <br/>\n <br/>\n <img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1703340/extras/TheEnd_scroll.gif?t=1712065263\"/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n <strong>\n  What's New?\n </strong>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n Everything that was in the original Stanley Parable is here, preserved just like it was back in 2013. But The Stanley Parable: Ultra Deluxe also dramatically expands the world of the original game with new content, new choices, and new secrets to uncover. The labyrinth has just gotten bigger.\n <br/>\n <br/>\n In addition, the game has been visually upgraded to reflect modern technology while faithfully preserving the tone of the original game. Accessibility features have also been added to the game, including localization of in-world text, colorblind options, and content warnings.\n <br/>\n <br/>\n And just as before, the impeccable voicework of Kevan Brighting will accompany you every step of the way.\n <br/>\n <br/>\n <img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1703340/extras/Teasers.gif?t=1712065263\"/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n In The Stanley Parable: Ultra Deluxe, everything you remember has been recreated, yet it's different somehow. We've been here before, haven't we? Is Stanley still the same as he was back then? Or is it you who has changed?\n</div>\n",

But the death of his best friend Nick calls the former investigative journalist back to confront the town’s troubled past—and his own. He soon becomes drawn into a dangerous web of intrigue as all is not as it seems in the small town of Basswood, West Virginia. Forced to face himself and the townsfolk, Sam struggles to balance the scales of reconciliation and his life-changing investigation. He must decide how much he’s willing to risk to uncover the mysteries of his hometown.\n <br/>\n <br/>\n <strong>\n  REMEMBER, REFLECT, REVEAL\n </strong>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n Explore Sam’s unique and analytical ways in his expansive Mind Palace, where you can revisit his past, relive old memories, and reconstruct events. There, you can go through possible scenarios, envision how things could’ve gone, and follow the clues to your next lead. Be careful, though—the Mind Palace is a reflection of Sam’s state of mind, for better or worse.\n <br/>\n <br/>\n <strong>\n  THE TWIN MIRROR\n </strong>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n You can also speak with your Double, who is the more social and empathic side of yourself that nobody else can see. You must navigate the dangers of Sam’s conflicted thoughts and feelings together: will your Double become a trusted confidante or an unwelcome guest?\n <br/>\n <br/>\n <strong>\n  CHOOSE YOUR PATH\n </strong>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n In Twin Mirror, every decision you make alters the course of your investigation, as well as your relationships in Basswood. Trust others or rely only on yourself in your hunt for the truth. But no matter your choices, your story is yours. Take a look in the mirror—what will you see?\n</div>\n",

This time around Meat Boy is always running, like\n <strong>\n  literally...it's an auto-runner\n </strong>\n . He can't stop and he won't stop. Levels are brutal, death is inevitable, and players will get that sweet feeling of accomplishment after beating a level. Players will run, jump, punch and kick their way through familiar settings and totally new worlds.\n <br/>\n <br/>\n What’s better than playing through Super Meat Boy Forever once? The answer is simple: Playing through Super Meat Boy Forever several times and having new levels to play each time.\n <strong>\n  We created over 6000 level chunks\n </strong>\n and smash them together to create new unique levels and each time the game is completed the option to replay the game appears and generates a whole new experience by presenting different levels with their own unique secret locations. We’ve handcrafted literally thousands of levels for players to enjoy and conquer. You can replay Super Meat Boy Forever from start to finish several times before ever seeing a duplicate level. It is truly a remarkable feat of engineering and a monumental example of ignoring the limits of rational game design and production.\n <br/>\n <br/>\n Super Meat Boy Forever takes place a few years after the events of Super Meat Boy. Meat Boy and Bandage Girl have been living a happy life free of Dr. Fetus for several years and they now have a wonderful little baby named Nugget. Nugget is joy personified and she is everything to Meat Boy and Bandage Girl. One day while our heroes were on a picnic, Dr. Fetus snuck up on them, beat Meat Boy and Bandage Girl unconscious with a shovel and kidnapped Nugget! When our heroes came to and found that Nugget was missing, they knew who to go after. They cracked their knuckles and decided to never stop until they got Nugget back and taught Dr. Fetus a very important lesson. A lesson that can only be taught with punches and kicks.\n</div>\n",

Additional options include a population density slider to control car and pedestrian traffic, as well as dual and triple monitor support, 3D compatibility, and plug-and-play controller support.\n <br/>\n <br/>\n Grand Theft Auto V for PC also includes Grand Theft Auto Online, with support for 30 players and two spectators. Grand Theft Auto Online for PC will include all existing gameplay upgrades and Rockstar-created content released since the launch of Grand Theft Auto Online, including Heists and Adversary modes.\n <br/>\n <br/>\n The PC version of Grand Theft Auto V and Grand Theft Auto Online features First Person Mode, giving players the chance to explore the incredibly detailed world of Los Santos and Blaine County in an entirely new way.\n <br/>\n <br/>\n Grand Theft Auto V for PC also brings the debut of the Rockstar Editor, a powerful suite of creative tools to quickly and easily capture, edit and share game footage from within Grand Theft Auto V and Grand Theft Auto Online. The Rockstar Editor’s Director Mode allows players the ability to stage their own scenes using prominent story characters, pedestrians, and even animals to bring their vision to life. Along with advanced camera manipulation and editing effects including fast and slow motion, and an array of camera filters, players can add their own music using songs from GTAV radio stations, or dynamically control the intensity of the game’s score. Completed videos can be uploaded directly from the Rockstar Editor to YouTube and the Rockstar Games Social Club for easy sharing.\n <br/>\n <br/>\n Soundtrack artists The Alchemist and Oh No return as hosts of the new radio station, The Lab FM. The station features new and exclusive music from the production duo based on and inspired by the game’s original soundtrack. Collaborating guest artists include Earl Sweatshirt, Freddie Gibbs, Little Dragon, Killer Mike, Sam Herring from Future Islands, and more. Players can also discover Los Santos and Blaine County while enjoying their own music through Self Radio, a new radio station that will host player-created custom soundtracks.\n</div>\n",

        "desc": "<div class=\"game_area_description\" id=\"game_area_description\">\n <h2>\n  About This Game\n </h2>\n Outnumbered and outgunned, but not outmatched.\n <br/>\n <br/>\n Call of Duty®: Ghosts is an extraordinary step forward for one of the largest entertainment franchises of all-time. This new chapter in the Call of Duty® franchise features a new dynamic where players are on the side of a crippled nation fighting not for freedom, or liberty, but simply to survive.\n <br/>\n <br/>\n Fueling this all new Call of Duty experience, the franchise's new next-gen engine delivers stunning levels of immersion and performance, all while maintaining the speed and fluidity of 60 frames-per-second across all platforms.\n <br/>\n <br/>\n <strong>\n  Single Player Campaign\n </strong>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n <ul class=\"bb_ul\">\n  <li>\n   Ten years after a devastating mass event, America’s borders and the balance of global power have changed forever. As what's left of the nation's Special Operations forces, a mysterious group known only as \"Ghosts\" leads the fight back against a newly emerged, technologically-superior global power.\n   <br/>\n   <br/>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   A New Call of Duty Universe: For the first time in franchise history, players will take on the underdog role with Call of Duty: Ghosts; outnumbered and outgunned, players must fight to reclaim a fallen nation in an intensely personal narrative. Gamers will get to know an entirely new cast of characters and visit locales in a changed world unlike anything seen in Call of Duty® before.\n  </li>\n </ul>\n <br/>\n <strong>\n  Multiplayer\n </strong>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n <ul class=\"bb_ul\">\n  <li>\n   In Call of Duty: Ghosts you don't just create a class, you create a soldier, a first for the franchise. In the new Create-A-Soldier system, players can change the physical appearance of their soldier by choosing the head, body type, head-gear and equipment, and for the first time in a Call of Duty® game, the player can also choose their gender. With 20,000 possible combinations, this is the most flexible and comprehensive character customization in Call of Duty history.\n   <br/>\n   <br/>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   New dynamic maps are the evolution of multiplayer. They include interactive elements and player triggered events that make the environment evolve as each match goes on. The entire landscape can shift and force players to change tactics and strategies.\n   <br/>\n   <br/>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   Call of Duty: Ghosts introduces new tactical player movements. The new contextual lean system now allows players to lean around obstacles without adding button combinations or fully leaving cover. The new mantling system allows fluid movement over objects, while maintaining momentum. The knee slide allows for a natural transition from sprinting crouching to prone.\n   <br/>\n   <br/>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   Call of Duty: Ghosts delivers over 20 NEW Kill Streaks such as Juggernaut Maniac, the Helo Scout, the Vulture and the ODIN Strike. Players can even bring in guard dog Riley, from the single-player campaign, to protect and also to attack enemies. There are also over 30 NEW weapons, including an entirely new weapon class: Marksman Rifles.\n  </li>\n </ul>\n <br/>\n <strong>\n  Squads\n </strong>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n <ul class=\"bb_ul\">\n  <li>\n   Build your team and take up to 6 of them into battle in the all new Squads mode. This mode takes the best parts of the multiplayer experience and allows you to play either solo or cooperatively with the custom soldiers  created and leveled up in multiplayer.\n   <br/>\n   <br/>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   The load-out choices you make for your Squad members will directly change the AI behavior of your squad-mates. Give your soldier a sniper rifle and he'll behave like a sniper, and an SMG guy will be more run and gun.\n  </li>\n </ul>\n</div>\n",

The sequel to 2003's Call of Duty, winner of over 80 Game of the Year awards, Call of Duty 2 offers more immense, more intense, more realistic battles than ever before, thanks to the stunning visuals of the new COD™2 engine.\n <br/>\n <ul class=\"bb_ul\">\n  <li>\n   The #1 WWII shooter development team returns with an amazing new experience: Developed by Infinity Ward, creators of the award-winning Call of Duty. All-new, unprecedented enhancements from stunningly realistic graphics to seamless gameplay, thanks to the revolutionary COD2 engine, groundbreaking AI, and choice-based gameplay innovations. Beautifully rendered snow, rain, fog, and smoke, combined with dynamic lighting and shadows, make this the most intense WWII shooter yet.\n   <br/>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   New conflicts and enemies to face: Call of Duty 2 brings you bigger battles, with more tanks, troops, and explosions on-screen, and bigger scope, with a wide range of locales and environments across the European Theater. Fight \"The Desert Fox\" across the scorching sands of North Africa as wave upon wave of tanks clash in the desert. Use rocket-propelled grappling hooks alongside your Army Ranger squad to storm and scale the cliffs of Pointe du Hoc against a relentless German counterassault, and slog through urban chaos as a tank hunter in war-torn Russia.\n   <br/>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   Rely on your squad as never before: The dozens of Allied soldiers surrounding you are fully aware of the changing situations around them, and will let you know using an all-new, context-sensitive battle chatter system. They will draw enemy fire, lay down cover for you, use foxholes and moving tanks for cover, and warn you of incoming enemy troops and hostile fire.\n   <br/>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   Choice-based gameplay: Play through missions in the order you see fit. Will you decide to play first as a sniper or as a tank commander? It's your call. Open-ended battlefields allow you to individualize your tactics and choose the order in which you complete your objectives.\n   <br/>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   Multiplayer Mayhem: Go online for intense Axis vs. Allies team-based multiplayer action, building on the hugely popular Call of Duty multiplayer modes.\n  </li>\n </ul>\n</div>\n",

The king's powers have faded and he falls asleep for 400 days to regain his might. It is your duty to stay in the earthen palace until he awakens.\n <br/>\n <br/>\n As soon as you start, the game inevitably counts down the 400 days - even when you stop playing and exit the game.\n <br/>\n <br/>\n It is now up to you to decide what to do with your solitary existence beneath the soil. Don't stress yourself, you have plenty of time.\n <h2 class=\"bb_tag\">\n  Choose your playing style\n </h2>\n Start the game and simply come back after 400 days to see how it ends. You actually don't have to play the game at all.

You are a man named Henry who has retreated from his messy life to work as a fire lookout in the Wyoming wilderness. Perched high atop a mountain, it’s your job to look for smoke and keep the wilderness safe. An especially hot, dry summer has everyone on edge. Your supervisor Delilah is available to you at all times over a small, handheld radio—your only contact with the world you've left behind. But when something strange draws you out of your lookout tower and into the forest, you’ll explore a wild and unknown environment, facing questions and making choices that can build or destroy the only meaningful relationship you have.\n <br/>\n <br/>\n <strong>\n  A Note:\n </strong>\n Firewatch is a video game about adults having adult conversations about adult things.

In DEATHLOOP, two rival assassins are trapped in a mysterious timeloop on the island of Blackreef, doomed to repeat the same day for eternity. As Colt, the only chance for escape is to end the cycle by assassinating eight key targets before the day resets. Learn from each cycle - try new paths, gather intel, and find new weapons and abilities. Do whatever it takes to break the loop.\n <h2 class=\"bb_tag\">\n  If At First You Don’t Succeed... Die, Die Again\n </h2>\n Every new loop is an opportunity to change things up. Use the knowledge you gain from each attempt to change up your playstyle, stealthily sneaking through levels or barreling into the fight, guns-blazing. In each loop you’ll discover new secrets, gather intel on your targets as well as the island of Blackreef, and expand your arsenal. Armed with a host of otherworldly abilities and savage weaponry, you’ll utilize every tool at your command to execute takedowns that are as striking as they are devastating. Customize your loadout wisely to survive this deadly game of hunter vs hunted.\n <br/>\n <img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1252330/extras/Deathloop_Action_02.gif?t=1705940190\"/>\n <h2 class=\"bb_tag\">\n  SINGLE PLAYER GAMEPLAY INJECTED WITH DEADLY MULTIPLAYER\n </h2>\n Are you the hero or the villain? You’ll experience DEATHLOOP’s main story as Colt, hunting down targets across the island of Blackreef to break the loop and earn your freedom. All the while, you’ll be hunted by your rival Julianna, who can be controlled by another player. So if you’re feeling devious, you, too, can step into Julianna’s stylish sneakers and invade another player’s campaign to kill Colt. The multiplayer experience is completely optional, and players can choose to have Julianna controlled by AI within their campaign.\n <br/>\n <img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1252330/extras/Deathloop_Julianna.gif?t=1705940190\"/>\n <h2 class=\"bb_tag\">\n  The island Of Blackreef – Paradise Or Prison\n </h2>\n Arkane is renowned for magnificently artistic worlds with multiple pathways and emergent gameplay. DEATHLOOP will present a stunning, retro-future, 60s-inspired environment, that feels like a character within itself. While Blackreef may be a stylish wonderland, for Colt it is his prison, a world ruled by decadence where death has no meaning, and delinquents party forever while keeping him captive.\n <br/>\n <img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1252330/extras/Deathloop_Enviro.gif?t=1705940190\"/>\n</div>\n",

Safety, security, and secrecy are of the utmost importance… usually.\n <br/>\n <br/>\n After a catastrophic containment breach, your workplace has become a cosmic battle zone: anomalous entities are on the loose, enemies from other dimensions are invading via portals, and an arcane military sect - known as The Order - is targeting personnel and entities indiscriminately, aiming to seize artifacts and put an end to the chaos.\n <br/>\n <br/>\n Containment procedures have failed and help isn’t on the way. Stranded miles beneath the surface, it’s up to you and your fellow scientists to band together, plan your escape, and make this underground complex your new home - for now.\n <br/>\n <br/>\n <img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/427410/extras/coffee_tall_new.gif?t=1728597542\"/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n <img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/427410/extras/SteamHeader_Gameplay.png?t=1728597542\"/>\n <br/>\n <strong>\n  Abiotic Factor brings a 90’s sci-fi twist and rich character progression to the multiplayer open world survival crafting genre.\n </strong>\n Up to 6 players can choose their PHDs, build their scientist, gear up, and explore a massive subterranean complex, filled with supernatural artifacts, transdimensional foes, and science experiments gone awry.\n <br/>\n <br/>\n <img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/427410/extras/Team_Work_Action.gif?t=1728597542\"/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n <img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/427410/extras/science_meets_violence_header.png?t=1728597542\"/>\n <br/>\n Between alien threats hunting their next meal, trigger happy soldiers, and the world’s most advanced robotic security forces attacking personnel working overtime, there’s no shortage of danger. As a scientist, fighting isn’t your forte, so you’ll need to put your PHD to work to outwit your opponents: craft ingenious and outlandish tools, weapons and gear, from simple nets and wooden bats to laser-cannons and elaborate traps - everything your big science brain can muster!\n <br/>\n <br/>\n <img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/427410/extras/Crafting_Inventions_v2.gif?t=1728597542\"/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n <img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/427410/extras/maintain_header.png?t=1728597542\"/>\n <br/>\n Make yourself at home - you’re here for the long haul. Scavenge resources from vacant offices and empty labs, raid vending machines, and steal company property to build a new base of operations as you explore the facility. When it’s time for a change of scenery, pack up your belongings and move them across the facility using handcarts, forklifts, SUVs, teleporters, and more.\n <br/>\n <br/>\n <img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/427410/extras/Team_Work_Chill.gif?t=1728597542\"/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n <img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/427410/extras/ultimate_header.png?t=1728597542\"/>\n <br/>\n Don your lab coat and earn your PhD: from Plant Geneticist to Defense Analyst and Structural Engineer (and many, many more), each with its own advantages essential to survival. Combine traits and skills, then level up to earn perks and abilities with your fellow scientists to forge a formidable scientific force.\n <br/>\n <br/>\n <img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/427410/extras/Stats_v2.gif?t=1728597542\"/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n <img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/427410/extras/survive_header.png?t=1728597542\"/>\n <br/>\n Working at GATE may have been a dream job, but dying here wasn’t part of your five year plan.

Play as both Bread and Fred in their exasperating and sometimes maddening climb that requires precision with every jump. Each time you land you’ll be closer to the peak and one step closer to mastering the platforming, but your fall down the mountain will be even farther.\n <br/>\n <br/>\n <img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1607680/extras/NUEVOS-GIFS-1.gif?t=1726076899\"/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n <strong>\n  <h2 class=\"bb_tag\">\n   Penguin Mechanics:\n  </h2>\n </strong>\n <br/>\n <strong>\n  - Swing to reach distant platforms!\n </strong>\n <br/>\n Bread and Fred are attached to each other. That means you don’t only fall together, but you can make good use of momentum to swing and propel each other beyond what any single penguin could have ever jumped. Make sure one of you anchors down to the ground or you’ll both fall!\n <br/>\n <br/>\n <strong>\n  - Hold on to walls as long as you can!\n </strong>\n <br/>\n The penguins’ little hands aren't very good, but you can hang on a wall with your partner for a few seconds to swing them around and overcome the next obstacle. Be careful though. These penguins are chubby so you can’t hold on long. Act fast!\n <br/>\n <br/>\n <strong>\n  - Single-player mode!\n </strong>\n <br/>\n Can’t find your penguin buddy? Strap your rope to Jeff (a rock!) and use it instead! The climb will all be up to you and your skill, but that also means you have no one to blame when you fall...\n <br/>\n <br/>\n Legends say that with these skills, a few penguin heroes have managed to reach the top. Will you be one of them?\n <br/>\n <br/>\n <img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1607680/extras/NUEVOS-GIFS-2.gif?t=1726076899\"/>\n <img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1607680/extras/NUEVOS-GIFS-3.gif?t=1726076899\"/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n Each fall will hurt, but try to learn and laugh through it. Think carefully about each jump and master the penguin skills to reach the summit.\n <br/>\n <br/>\n For the craziest climbers,\n <strong>\n  <i>\n   Bread &amp; Fred\n  </i>\n </strong>\n includes a speedrun mode so you can compete and be crowned the best penguins on the planet.\n <br/>\n <br/>\n <u>\n  <i>\n   <strong>\n    The mountain awaits you. Complete your mission. Cooperate with each other and you will be able to go far up the mountain. Just try not to fall (too much). Good luck!!\n   </strong>\n  </i>\n </u>\n</div>\n",

CUSTOMIZATION\n <br/>\n Assetto Corsa will allow for considerable customisation and modification, in order to satisfy the expectations of professional simracers, gamers who prefer to approach the driving experience more progressively, and hobbyists who just like to reproduce and share their cars and tracks, taking advantage of the same editing tools developed and used by the developers of the game.\n <h2 class=\"bb_tag\">\n  Available content:\n </h2>\n <br/>\n <strong>\n  CARS\n </strong>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n PRODUCTION\n <br/>\n - Abarth 595 EsseEsse (3 variants)\n <br/>\n - Abarth 500 EsseEsse (2 variants)\n <br/>\n - Alfa Romeo 33 Stradale\n <br/>\n - Alfa Romeo Giulia Quadrifoglio\n <br/>\n - Alfa Romeo Giulietta QV\n <br/>\n - Alfa Romeo Giulietta QV Launch Edition\n <br/>\n - Alfa Romeo MiTo QV\n <br/>\n - Audi Sport Quattro (2 variants)\n <br/>\n - Audi S1\n <br/>\n - Bmw 1M (2 variants)\n <br/>\n - Lamborghini Miura S.V.\n <br/>\n - Lotus Elise SC (3 variants)\n <br/>\n - Maserati Alfieri\n <br/>\n - Maserati Quattroporte GTS\n <br/>\n - Maserati Levante S\n <br/>\n - Mazda MX-5 NA\n <br/>\n - Porsche Panamera G2\n <br/>\n - Porsche Cayenne Turbo S\n <br/>\n - Porsche Macan Turbo\n <br/>\n - Shelby Cobra\n <br/>\n - RUF CTR Yellowbird\n <br/>\n - Toyota GT-86\n <br/>\n - Ford Mustang 2015\n <br/>\n - Chevrolet Corvette C7 Stingray\n <br/>\n <br/>\n GT\n <br/>\n - Bmw M3 E30 Evo (3 variants)\n <br/>\n - Bmw M3 E30 Group A\n <br/>\n - Bmw M3 E30 DTM\n <br/>\n - Bmw M3 E92 (3 variants)\n <br/>\n - Bmw Z4 E89 (3 variants)\n <br/>\n - Lotus Evora GTC\n <br/>\n - Lotus Evora GX\n <br/>\n <br/>\n GTR\n <br/>\n - McLaren MP4-12c GT3\n <br/>\n - Bmw Z4 GT3\n <br/>\n - Bmw M3 GT2\n <br/>\n - Ferrari 458 GT2\n <br/>\n - P4/5 Competizione\n <br/>\n - Mercedes SLS GT3\n <br/>\n <br/>\n CLASSIC GP\n <br/>\n - Classic Team Lotus Type 49\n <br/>\n - Classic Team Lotus 98T\n <br/>\n - Ferrari 312T\n <br/>\n <br/>\n RALLY\n <br/>\n - Audi Sport Quattro S1 E2\n <br/>\n <br/>\n ENDURANCE\n <br/>\n - Mazda 787B\n <br/>\n <br/>\n SUPERCAR\n <br/>\n - Audi R8 Plus\n <br/>\n - Ferrari LaFerrari\n <br/>\n - Ferrari 458 Italia (2 variants)\n <br/>\n - Ferrari F40 (2 variants)\n <br/>\n - Ferrari 599xx\n <br/>\n - Lamborghini Huracán Performante\n <br/>\n - Lamborghini Sesto Elemento\n <br/>\n - McLaren Mp4 12c\n <br/>\n - Mercedes SLS AMG\n <br/>\n - Nissan GTR NISMO\n <br/>\n - Pagani Zonda R\n <br/>\n - Pagani Huayra\n <br/>\n - Pagani Huayra BC\n <br/>\n - Lotus Evora S (2 variants)\n <br/>\n - Lotus Exige S Roadster\n <br/>\n - Lotus Exige Scura\n <br/>\n - Lotus 2 Eleven GT4\n <br/>\n <br/>\n TRACKDAY\n <br/>\n - KTM X-Bow R\n <br/>\n - Lotus 2 Eleven\n <br/>\n - Lotus Evora GTE\n <br/>\n - Lotus Evora GTE Carbon\n <br/>\n - Lotus Exige 240R (2 variants)\n <br/>\n - Lotus Exige V6 Cup\n <br/>\n <br/>\n OPEN WHEEL\n <br/>\n - Tatuus FA-01\n <br/>\n - Lotus Exos T125 (2 variants)\n <br/>\n <br/>\n <strong>\n  TRACKS\n </strong>\n <br/>\n - Laguna Seca\n <br/>\n - Magione - \"Autodromo dell'Umbria\"\n <br/>\n - Imola - \"Autodromo Enzo e Dino Ferrari\"\n <br/>\n - Mugello - \"Autodromo Internazionale del Mugello\"\n <br/>\n - Silverstone - GP\n <br/>\n - Silverstone - International\n <br/>\n - Silverstone - National\n <br/>\n - Silverstone 1967\n <br/>\n - Monza - \"Autodromo di Monza\"\n <br/>\n - Monza - \"Classic 60's Edition\" (3 variants)\n <br/>\n - Nurburgring - GP\n <br/>\n - Nurburgring - Sprint\n <br/>\n - Spa Francorchamps\n <br/>\n - Vallelunga - \"Autodromo Piero Taruffi\"\n <br/>\n - Vallelunga - Circuito Club\n <br/>\n - Zandvoort\n <br/>\n - Trento - Bondone Hillclimb\n <br/>\n - Drift Track\n <br/>\n - Drag strip\n <br/>\n - Black Cat County (fantasy track)\n <br/>\n - Highlands (fantasy track)\n <br/>\n <br/>\n <strong>\n  SHOWROOMS\n </strong>\n <br/>\n - Standard showroom\n <br/>\n - The Beach\n <br/>\n - Hangar\n <br/>\n - Industrial\n <br/>\n - Sunset\n <br/>\n <br/>\n <strong>\n  GAME MODES\n </strong>\n <br/>\n - Free Practice\n <br/>\n - Racing against AI\n <br/>\n - Career\n <br/>\n - Custom championship\n <br/>\n - Online Multiplayer\n <br/>\n - HotLap\n <br/>\n - Time Attack\n <br/>\n - Special Events\n <br/>\n - Drift\n <br/>\n - Drag race\n <br/>\n <br/>\n <strong>\n  FEATURES\n </strong>\n <br/>\n - In game telemetry and apps\n <br/>\n - Advanced car setup management\n <br/>\n - Flags\n <br/>\n - Penalties\n <br/>\n <br/>\n <strong>\n  APPS LIST\n </strong>\n <br/>\n - Basic info\n <br/>\n - Chat app\n <br/>\n - Tyre app\n <br/>\n - Real time app\n <br/>\n - Help\n <br/>\n - Lap time\n <br/>\n - Pit stop presets\n <br/>\n - Friends Leaderboard\n <br/>\n - Camera On Board Customization\n <br/>\n - Time of the day display\n <br/>\n - Input monitor\n <br/>\n - Time performance indicator\n <br/>\n - Gear/rpm indicator\n <br/>\n - Track map\n <br/>\n - Rankings\n <br/>\n - G-meter indicator\n</div>\n",

New Vegas.\n <br/>\n It’s the kind of town where you dig your own grave prior to being shot in the head and left for dead…and that’s before things really get ugly. It’s a town of dreamers and desperados being torn apart by warring factions vying for complete control of this desert oasis. It’s a place where the right kind of person with the right kind of weaponry can really make a name for themselves, and make more than an enemy or two along the way.\n <br/>\n As you battle your way across the heat-blasted Mojave Wasteland, the colossal Hoover Dam, and the neon drenched Vegas Strip, you’ll be introduced to a colorful cast of characters, power-hungry factions, special weapons, mutated creatures and much more. Choose sides in the upcoming war or declare “winner takes all” and crown yourself the King of New Vegas in this follow-up to the 2008 videogame of the year, Fallout 3.\n <br/>\n Enjoy your stay.\n <h2 class=\"bb_tag\">\n  Key Features\n </h2>\n <strong>\n  Feel the Heat in New Vegas!\n </strong>\n Not even nuclear fallout could slow the hustle of Sin City. Explore the vast expanses of the desert wastelands – from the small towns dotting the Mojave Wasteland to the bright lights of the New Vegas strip. See the Great Southwest as could only be imagined in Fallout.\n <br/>\n <strong>\n  Feuding Factions, Colorful Characters and a Host of Hostiles!\n </strong>\n A war is brewing between rival factions with consequences that will change the lives of all the inhabitants of New Vegas. The choices you make will bring you into contact with countless characters, creatures, allies, and foes, and determine the final explosive outcome of this epic power struggle.\n <br/>\n <strong>\n  New Systems!\n </strong>\n Enjoy new additions to\n <strong>\n  Fallout: New Vegas\n </strong>\n such as a Companion Wheel that streamlines directing your companions, a Reputation System that tracks the consequences of your actions, and the aptly titled Hardcore Mode to separate the meek from the mighty. Special melee combat moves have been added to bring new meaning to the phrase “up close and personal”.  Use V.A.T.S. to pause time in combat, target specific enemy body parts and queue up attacks, or get right to the action using the finely-tuned real-time combat mechanics.\n <br/>\n <strong>\n  An Arsenal of Shiny New Guns!\n </strong>\n With double the amount of weapons found in Fallout 3, you’ll have more than enough new and exciting ways to deal with the threats of the wasteland and the locals. In addition, Vault-Tec engineers have devised a new weapons configuration system that lets you tinker with your toys and see the modifications you make in real time.\n <br/>\n <strong>\n  Let it Ride!\n </strong>\n In a huge, open world with unlimited options you can see the sights, choose sides, or go it alone. Peacemaker or Hard Case, House Rules, or the Wild Card - it’s all in how you play the game.\n</div>\n",

HALF-LIFE sends a shock through the game industry with its combination of pounding action and continuous, immersive storytelling. Valve's debut title wins more than 50 game-of-the-year awards on its way to being named \"Best PC Game Ever\" by PC Gamer, and launches a franchise with more than eight million retail units sold worldwide.\n <br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n NOW. By taking the suspense, challenge and visceral charge of the original, and adding startling new realism and responsiveness, Half-Life 2 opens the door to a world where the player's presence affects everything around them, from the physical environment to the behaviors even the emotions of both friends and enemies.\n <br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n The player again picks up the crowbar of research scientist Gordon Freeman, who finds himself on an alien-infested Earth being picked to the bone, its resources depleted, its populace dwindling. Freeman is thrust into the unenviable role of rescuing the world from the wrong he unleashed back at Black Mesa. And a lot of people he cares about are counting on him.\n <br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n The intense, real-time gameplay of Half-Life 2 is made possible only by Source®, Valve's new proprietary engine technology. Source provides major enhancements in:\n <br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n <ul class=\"bb_ul\">\n  <li>\n   Characters: Advanced facial animation system delivers the most sophisticated in-game characters ever seen. With 40 distinct facial \"muscles,\" human characters convey the full array of human emotion, and respond to the player with fluidity and intelligence.\n   <br/>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   Physics: From pebbles to water to 2-ton trucks respond as expected, as they obey the laws of mass, friction, gravity, and buoyancy.\n   <br/>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   Graphics: Source's shader-based renderer, like the one used at Pixar to create movies such as Toy Story® and Monster's, Inc.®, creates the most beautiful and realistic environments ever seen in a video game.\n   <br/>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   AI: Neither friends nor enemies charge blindly into the fray. They can assess threats, navigate tricky terrain, and fashion weapons from whatever is at hand.\n   <br/>\n  </li>\n </ul>\n</div>\n",

Thrust into a raging civil war, you watch helplessly as invaders storm your village and slaughter your friends and family.  Narrowly escaping the brutal attack, you grab your sword to fight back. Avenge the death of your parents and help repel the invading forces!\n <h2 class=\"bb_tag\">\n  Story:\n </h2>\n Bohemia – located in the heart of Europe, the region is rich in culture, silver, and sprawling castles. The death of its beloved ruler, Emperor Charles IV, has plunged the kingdom into dark times: war, corruption, and discord are tearing this jewel of the Holy Roman Empire apart.\n <br/>\n <br/>\n One of Charles' sons, Wenceslas, has inherited the crown. Unlike his father, Wenceslas is a naive, self-indulgent, unambitious monarch. His half-brother and King of Hungary, Sigismund the Red Fox, senses weakness in Wenceslas. Feigning good will, Sigismund travels to Bohemia and kidnaps his half-brother. With no king on the throne, Sigismund is now free to plunder Bohemia and seize its riches.\n <br/>\n <br/>\n In the midst of this chaos, you're Henry, the son of a blacksmith. Your peaceful life is shattered when a mercenary raid, ordered by King Sigismund himself, burns your village to the ground. By bittersweet fortune, you are one of the few survivors of this massacre.\n <br/>\n <br/>\n Without a home, family, or future you end up in the service of Lord Radzig Kobyla, who is forming a resistance against the invasion.

In First Class Trouble you either deceive or deduce your way to victory in a charming, yet unsettling and often mischievous environment. Whether you do it sober or with a slight buzz, First Class Trouble will serve you a dangerous cocktail of difficult decisions and whacky possibilities.\n <br/>\n <br/>\n The goal is to shut down the Central Artificial Intelligence Network, also known as CAIN, of the luxurious intergalactic cruise ship ISS Alithea before it and its loyal Personoids take control of the ship.\n <br/>\n <br/>\n <img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/953880/extras/FCT_SteamPageAssets00_TwoRoles_small.png?t=1719822455\"/>\n <br/>\n <img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/953880/extras/FCT_SteamPageAssets_ImageFlush_00_small.png?t=1719822455\"/>\n <br/>\n <img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/953880/extras/FCT_SteamPageAssets00_ResidentGameplay_small.png?t=1719822455\"/>\n <br/>\n Collect information about the passengers and deduce who you can trust and who to avoid.

Use your unique skills to communicate and navigate the ship in the shadows and kill off residents when they pose a threat to your identity.\n <br/>\n <br/>\n <img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/953880/extras/FCT_UpdatesTitlesTemplate_616x42.png?t=1719822455\"/>\n <br/>\n Aboard the ISS Alithea, the customization possibilities are endless.

We invite you to join us on a journey into madness, where each encounter could be your last. With each step you take closer to unravelling Derceto's mystery, the eyes that watch from the darkness grow hungrier. Every bullet means the difference between survival and an unthinkable end. The next door you unlock could lead to a nightmarish realm offering nothing but slashing claws, grasping tentacles, and frayed sanity.

When inmates begin to transform into monstrous creatures, the prison is thrown into chaos. To survive, Jacob must battle his way to safety to escape Black Iron Prison, while uncovering the dark and disturbing secrets buried beneath the surface of Callisto. Using a unique blend of shooting and close-quarters combat, Jacob will need to adapt his tactics to combat the rapidly evolving creatures while scavenging to unlock new weapons, gear, and abilities to outrun the growing threat and escape the horrors of Jupiter's Dead Moon.\n <h2 class=\"bb_tag\">\n  HORROR ENGINEERING\n </h2>\n The Callisto Protocol is a next-generation take on survival horror from the mind of Glen Schofield. Blending atmosphere, tension, and brutality with terrifying moments of helplessness and humanity, The Callisto Protocol immerses players in a pulse-pounding story where unspeakable horrors lurk around every corner.\n <h2 class=\"bb_tag\">\n  UNCOVER THE SECRETS OF THE UNITED JUPITER COMPANY\n </h2>\n Set on Jupiter’s dead moon Callisto in the year 2320, The Callisto Protocol casts players as Jacob Lee, an inmate in Black Iron Prison. When a mysterious outbreak throws the moon into chaos, Jacob must face his darkest fears to defeat the bloodthirsty creatures that stalk him as he unravels the dark mysteries at the heart of the powerful United Jupiter Company.\n <h2 class=\"bb_tag\">\n  MASTER BRUTAL, STRATEGIC COMBAT\n </h2>\n The Callisto Protocol challenges players to master a thrilling blend of hand-to-hand and ranged combat, including a unique gravity weapon once used by Black Iron guards to control the prison population. Players will be forced to get up close and personal with their grotesque opponents, hacking off limbs, blasting off legs, and getting creative with whatever is at their disposal to survive each life-or-death encounter.\n <h2 class=\"bb_tag\">\n  EXPERIENCE THE ISOLATION OF JUPITER'S DEAD MOON\n </h2>\n One of the most hostile, isolated environments in the universe, Callisto looms large over Jacob’s desperate struggle to survive. Players must not only contend with the horrors of Black Iron Prison, but also the centuries-old secrets that plague Jupiter’s long-dead moon, both above and below the surface.\n <br/>\n <br/>\n <strong>\n  Also Includes:\n </strong>\n Gore Skin Collection\n</div>\n",

We buy the latest gadgets and gear. We find out what’s happening in the world. But with that same simple swipe, we cast an increasingly expansive shadow. With each connection, we leave a digital trail that tracks our every move and milestone, our every like and dislike. And it’s not just people. Today, all major cities are networked. Urban infrastructures are monitored and controlled by complex operating systems.\n <br/>\n <br/>\n In Watch_Dogs, this system is called the Central Operating System (CTOS) – and it controls almost every piece of the city’s technology and holds key information on all of the city’s residents.\n <br/>\n <br/>\n You play as Aiden Pearce, a brilliant hacker and former thug, whose criminal past led to a violent family tragedy.  Now on the hunt for those who hurt your family, you'll be able to monitor and hack all who surround you by manipulating everything connected to the city’s network. Access omnipresent security cameras, download personal information to locate a target, control traffic lights and public transportation to stop the enemy…and more.\n <br/>\n <br/>\n Use the city of Chicago as your ultimate weapon and exact your own style of revenge.\n <h2 class=\"bb_tag\">\n  KEY FEATURES\n </h2>\n <br/>\n <strong>\n  HACK THE CITY\n </strong>\n <br/>\n Watch_Dogs takes place in a fully simulated living city where, using your smartphone, you have real-time control over the city’s infrastructure.  Trap your enemy in a 30-car pileup by manipulating the traffic lights. Stop a train, and then board it to evade the authorities. Narrowly escape capture by quickly raising a drawbridge. Anything connected to the city’s CTOS can become your weapon.\n <br/>\n <br/>\n <strong>\n  STREET JUSTICE\n </strong>\n <br/>\n Living in inner city Chicago where violence is best answered by violence, you have the skills to take the fight to the streets. Take down enemies by delivering devastating blows with your baton, or experience a shoot-out like never before with a physics simulation that rivals anything in the shooter category. Use a combination of shooting and hacking to gain advantage in any given situation.  The streets are designed for you to create your own plan of attack. Overall, you will have access to more than 30 traditional weapons.\n <br/>\n <br/>\n <strong>\n  HIGH OCTANE DRIVING\n </strong>\n <br/>\n Ubisoft Montreal has partnered with studios such as Ubisoft Reflections, the acclaimed studio behind the award-winning Driver series to bring you a game bursting with horsepower. Get behind the wheel of more than 65 vehicles, each with state of the art physics and handling, and explore the massive city while completing missions.\n <br/>\n <br/>\n <strong>\n  EVERYTHING IS UNDER CONTROL\n </strong>\n <br/>\n Disrupt, the all-new game engine dedicated to Watch_Dogs, uses advanced processing and graphics to deliver a stunning visual and an incredibly realistic experience. Disrupt gives you the power to affect the story, the city and the life of the population with your choices creating a ripple effect throughout the city.\n <br/>\n <br/>\n <strong>\n  DYNAMIC NAVIGATION\n </strong>\n <br/>\n Watch_Dogs gives you the ability to not only use the city’s ctOS to your advantage, but the streets as well. In real-world Chicago, cut through buildings or climb to the rooftops to catch your target.\n <br/>\n <br/>\n <strong>\n  SEAMLESS MULTIPLAYER EXPERIENCE\n </strong>\n <br/>\n Discover new levels of interaction, cooperation and confrontation between players thanks to a brand new multiplayer game system that links the single and multiplayer modes into one seamless experience. That means no menus, no loading screens, just instant open world multiplayer action.\n</div>\n",

This 6-game epic culminates in multiple entirely canon, extremely different endings. Each step of the journey has you choose from options such as a Teleporter or calling in your buddy Charles to help you out. Correct choices will move the story forward, but incorrect choices lead to a fail. If you get to the end on your first try, you’re doing it wrong. Failing is half the fun.\n <h2 class=\"bb_tag\">\n  An Old Series, Remastered\n </h2>\n The Henry Stickmin games have seen some good times on the internet, but age has not been kind. Breaking the Bank has been completely reanimated from scratch. Escaping the Prison, Stealing the Diamond, Infiltrating the Airship and Fleeing the Complex have all had their backgrounds and sound effects redone!\n <br/>\n <br/>\n <img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1089980/extras/Compare.png?t=1619212064\"/>\n <h2 class=\"bb_tag\">\n  A Grand Finale\n </h2>\n A final game, Completing the Mission, is is featured in this collection. It's brand new, never before seen online!

On a quest to rebuild the Jedi Order, you must pick up the pieces of your shattered past to complete your training, develop new powerful Force abilities and master the art of the iconic lightsaber - all while staying one step ahead of the Empire and its deadly Inquisitors.\n <br/>\n <br/>\n While mastering your abilities, players will engage in cinematically charged lightsaber and Force combat designed to deliver the kind of intense Star Wars lightsaber battles as seen in the films. Players will need to approach enemies strategically, sizing up strengths and weaknesses while cleverly utilizing your Jedi training to overcome your opponents and solve the mysteries that lay in your path.\n <br/>\n <br/>\n Star Wars fans will recognize iconic locations, weapons, gear and enemies while also meeting a roster of fresh characters, locations, creatures, droids and adversaries new to Star Wars. As part of this authentic Star Wars story, fans will delve into a galaxy recently seized by the Empire. As a Jedi hero-turned-fugitive, players will need to fight for survival while exploring the mysteries of a long-extinct civilization all in an effort to rebuild the remnants of the Jedi Order as the Empire seeks to erase the Jedi completely.\n <h2 class=\"bb_tag\">\n  <strong>\n   KEY FEATURES\n  </strong>\n </h2>\n <ul class=\"bb_ul\">\n  <li>\n   <strong>\n    Cinematic, Immersive Combat\n   </strong>\n   – Jedi: Fallen Order delivers the fantasy of becoming a Jedi through its innovative lightsaber combat system–striking, parrying, dodging–partnered with a suite of powerful Force abilities you’ll need to leverage to overcome obstacles that stand in your way. This combat system is intuitive but takes training and practice to fully master its nuances as you gain new powers and abilities along your adventure.\n   <br/>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   <strong>\n    A New Jedi Story Begins\n   </strong>\n   - As a former Padawan on the run from the Empire, you must complete your training before Imperial Inquisitors discover your plan to revive the Jedi Order. Aided by a former Jedi Knight, a cantankerous pilot and a fearless droid, you must escape the evil machinations of the Empire in a story-driven adventure. Explore and overcome a wide range of challenges focused on combat, exploration and puzzle-solving.\n   <br/>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   <strong>\n    The Galaxy Awaits\n   </strong>\n   - Ancient forests, windswept rock faces and haunted jungles are all unique biomes you’ll explore in Jedi: Fallen Order, with the freedom to decide when and where you go next. As you unlock new powers and abilities, opportunities open up to re-traverse maps in new ways; leveraging the Force to augment the way you explore. Move quickly, however, as the Empire is actively hunting your every step in their effort to exterminate all remnants of the Jedi Order.\n  </li>\n </ul>\n</div>\n",

Join the police force of this fictitious American city and experience the day to day life of a Police Officer. Start with citing violations and giving out parking tickets, then work your way towards shouldering more responsibilities. Be part of the community of Brighton, get to know your neighborhood and handle daily police work to fight crime during your shift. Always be tough, but fair: respect the law and gain more experience to unlock more neighborhoods, districts and duties.\n <br/>\n <br/>\n <img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/997010/extras/PSPO-AC1539-NewSteamGifs-ProtectlYourCity.gif?t=1728485865\"/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n POLICE SIMULATOR: PATROL OFFICERS includes a dynamic traffic system that organically creates the traffic flow and car accidents, as well as emergency situations that can randomly pop up during your shift. Be ready to react at a moment’s notice! In the Open World of Brighton you will be able to choose neighborhoods for your patrols and make sure to keep them safe. Patrol through three unique districts with several neighborhoods each. Every single one has a distinct flair, from the high rises of Downtown to the historical buildings of Brickston.\n <br/>\n <br/>\n <img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/997010/extras/PSPO-AC1539-NewSteamGifs-UpholdTheLaw.gif?t=1728485865\"/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n With progression and unlocking new districts, additional duties will also be revealed. Start with ticketing duty and finding wrongfully parked cars, but be prepared to take care of accidents that may happen right in front of your eyes. In a living and breathing city, many different duties may be encountered. Stop drug deals taking place in the local park, or chase graffiti sprayers illegally tagging walls. Be prepared for anything - even if it is just a car blocking a bus stop. Every duty is your responsibility.\n <br/>\n <br/>\n <img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/997010/extras/PSPO-AC1539-NewSteamGifs-PatrolWithYourPartner.gif?t=1728485865\"/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n With the Intuition System your police officer will be able to pick up important clues during witness interrogations that could lead you to resolve situations the right way, so make sure you pay attention to everything being said and done.

Special Weapons and Tactics (SWAT) teams have been dispatched to respond to various scenes involving high-risk hostage situations, active bomb threats, barricaded suspects, and other criminal activities. Citizens are being advised to practice caution when traveling the city or to stay at home.\n <br/>\n <br/>\n It has been noted that while Los Sueños is still seen as a city where riches can be found, for many more the finer things in life are becoming less and less obtainable. “The city is sprawling with cramped high-rise apartments and decaying affordable housing, which has been exploited by the criminal underground like a malevolent parasite,” states Chief Galo Álvarez. “In a city where people are just trying to survive, lawful action from the LSPD and the LSPD SWAT team remains an integral force preventing the stretched thin social fabric in this city from snapping under this chaotic strain.”\n <br/>\n <br/>\n In response to the burgeoning violent crime wave inundating Los Sueños, Chief Álvarez of the LSPD has enlisted the stalwart support of David ‘Judge’ Beaumont as the Commander of the LSPD SWAT team. Shortly following this announcement, the LSPD has also confirmed active recruitment for additional talent to join this specialized tactical police unit with the mission of bringing peace back to the city.\n <br/>\n <br/>\n “This assignment is not for the faint of heart,” comments Commander Beaumont, “Extremists, crooked politicians, countless weapons, human trafficking, and illicit drugs and pornography… the world of policing in Los Sueños is fraught with real and harsh realities, realities that the everyday person isn’t necessarily confronted with. These are realities that you will need to navigate with your team within the proper bounds of the law or face the consequences and make matters worse.”\n <br/>\n <br/>\n The Los Sueños Policed Department has officially posted new details on Commander “Judge” Beaumont’s updated assignment with the LSPD SWAT team:\n <h2 class=\"bb_tag\">\n  New Expectations:\n </h2>\n Whether this is your first time in Los Sueños or not, the city has changed and so too have the tools and methods with which we conduct our work. The haunts you might have seen or heard about are re-imagined, and so have the angles with which we approach each call. Furthermore, we’ve received reports that identify at least 4 new high-risk police districts which we suspect may require future tactical intervention, plus at least 4 existing high-risk districts that underwent massive upheavals.\n <br/>\n <br/>\n <img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1144200/extras/sp_coop.png?t=1720713454\"/>\n <h2 class=\"bb_tag\">\n  Take Command:\n </h2>\n The role of the Commander of the LSPD SWAT is to compose their team from a large roster with unique talents, give tactical orders, meticulously plan, and carry out missions. Commanders are obligated to conduct each mission with integrity and look after their team’s mental and physical health. Officers with unaddressed deteriorating mental status may be unable to properly perform their duties or even feel compelled to quit the force. Incapacitated officers may be temporarily unavailable for missions, with the tragic prospect of death leading to a permanent loss. For SWAT Commanders in unusual circumstances based on individual choices they opt for, deadly mistakes may lead to their own permanent fatality.\n <br/>\n <br/>\n <img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1144200/extras/Image_05.png?t=1720713454\"/>\n <h2 class=\"bb_tag\">\n  SWAT Team Quality Enhancement:\n </h2>\n Much anticipated improved SWAT training procedures, tactics, and experience in the LSPD has led to an overall increase in the quality and quantity of officers in our roster. Expanded tactical versatility allows our officers to take on any challenge with renewed confidence, blending coordination and independence seamlessly. There is also additional basic training now available to SWAT members to keep foundational knowledge and muscle memory in top shape.\n <br/>\n <br/>\n <img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1144200/extras/authentic3.png?t=1720713454\"/>\n <h2 class=\"bb_tag\">\n  Equipment and customization:\n </h2>\n We have access to the best weapons and equipment that the LSPD can offer to fulfill our exceptionally dangerous role, including many new acquisitions. However, customization isn’t limited to the equipment we use. Through close-knit comradery while performing remarkable actions alongside the team, you’ll earn the clothes you wear, the patches on your sleeves, the artwork that may adorn your skin, and potentially even the timepiece on your wrist. Lastly, we have overhauled our headquarters' training facilities to better test our loadouts before heading out on call.\n</div>\n",

The world around you is full of danger, and you must face it – alone. Separated from your family in a devastating flood, you will need to find food and shelter between terrifying torrential downpours which threaten to drown all life. Climb through the ruins of an ancient civilization, evade the jaws of vicious predators, and discover new lands teeming with strange creatures and buried mysteries. Find your family before something makes a meal of you!\n <br/>\n <br/>\n Inspired by the simplicity and aesthetics of 16-bit classics, this survival platformer requires clever decision-making, both to catch your own prey and to avoid the jaws of hungry predators. Each ravenous foe in your path will be cunning, vicious and always on the hunt – eager to sink their teeth into you, or even each other. As a small, soft slugcat you must rely on stealth and wit rather than force: learn the ecosystem and turn their strengths to your advantage. Maybe then you can survive… Rain World!\n</div>\n",

In this game, you can peacefully live alongside mysterious creatures known as Pals or risk your life to drive off a ruthless poaching syndicate.\n <br/>\n <br/>\n Pals can be used to fight, or they can be made to work on farms or factories.\n <br/>\n You can even sell them or eat them!\n <br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n <strong>\n  <u>\n   Survival\n  </u>\n </strong>\n <br/>\n In a harsh environment where food is scarce and vicious poachers roam, danger waits around every corner. To survive, you must tread carefully and make difficult choices...even if that means eating your own Pals when the time comes.\n <br/>\n <img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1623730/extras/gif01_survival.gif?t=1728458632\"/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n <strong>\n  <u>\n   Mounts &amp; Exploration\n  </u>\n </strong>\n <br/>\n Pals can be mounted to traverse the land, sea and sky—allowing you to traverse all kinds of environment as you explore the world.\n <br/>\n <img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1623730/extras/gif02_riding.gif?t=1728458632\"/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n <strong>\n  <u>\n   Building Structures\n  </u>\n </strong>\n <br/>\n Want to build a pyramid? Put an army of Pals on the job.

Fly smoothly from deep space to planetary surfaces, with no loading screens, and no limits. In this infinite procedurally generated universe, you'll discover places and creatures that no other players have seen before - and perhaps never will again.\n <h2 class=\"bb_tag\">\n  Now including...\n </h2>\n Play with all major updates since launch: Foundation, Pathfinder, Atlas Rises, NEXT, The Abyss, Visions, the 2.0 BEYOND update, Synthesis, Living Ship, Exo Mech, Desolation and the 3.0 update, ORIGINS, Next Generation, Companions, Expeditions, Prisms, Frontiers, Sentinel, Outlaws, Endurance, Waypoint (4.0),  Fractal, Interceptor, Echoes, Omega, Orbital and Worlds Part I (5.0).\n <br/>\n <br/>\n Available for PC and Mac (see recommended and minimum specs for details).\n <br/>\n <br/>\n An epic voyage to the centre of a shared universe awaits, allowing you to explore, trade, fight and survive alone or with friends.\n <h2 class=\"bb_tag\">\n  Embark on an epic voyage\n </h2>\n At the centre of the galaxy lies a irresistible pulse which draws you on a journey towards it to learn the true nature of the cosmos. But, facing hostile creatures and fierce pirates, you'll know that death comes at a cost, and survival will be down to the choices you make over how you upgrade your ship, your weapon and suit.\n <h2 class=\"bb_tag\">\n  Find your own destiny\n </h2>\n Your voyage through No Man's Sky is up to you. Will you be a fighter, preying on the weak and taking their riches, or taking out pirates for their bounties? Power is yours if you upgrade your ship for speed and weaponry.\n <br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n Or a trader? Find rich resources on forgotten worlds and exploit them for the highest prices. Invest in more cargo space and you'll reap huge rewards.\n <br/>\n <br/>\n Or perhaps an explorer? Go beyond the known frontier and discover places and things that no one has ever seen before. Upgrade your engines to jump ever farther, and strengthen your suit for survival in toxic environments that would kill the unwary.\n <h2 class=\"bb_tag\">\n  Share your journey\n </h2>\n The galaxy is a living, breathing place. Trade convoys travel between stars, factions vie for territory, pirates hunt the unwary, and the police are ever watching. Every other player lives in the same galaxy, and you can choose to share your discoveries with them on a map that spans known space. Perhaps you will see the results of their actions as well as your own...\n</div>\n",

What appears to be an elegant, high-tech city on the outside, has a terrible secret hidden within. Explore every corner from the highest beautifully lit rooftops to the dark and gritty tunnels below. The city is huge, free to roam and Faith is at the center of it all. Through the first-person perspective, combine her fluid movement and advanced combat with the city's surroundings to master the environment and uncover the conspiracy.\n <br/>\n <br/>\n <img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1233570/extras/ME_Banner_features_610.png?t=1725569207\"/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n <strong>\n  TRAVERSAL\n </strong>\n <br/>\n Hit top speed quickly zipping down wire lines. Balance on pipes before smoothly dropping to a hang before climbing, hand over hand, under an obstacle. Run vertically and horizontally on any wall and use your environment to swing around corners or over gaps.\n <br/>\n <br/>\n <strong>\n  FOCUS\n </strong>\n <br/>\n Fast, light, and agile, Faith must stay focused and use her movement to survive. Focus is gained from free running, and once Faith has Focus enemies cannot hit her. Focus is lost from low speed and being attacked, so it is essential to maintain a balance of out-traversing opponents and engaging them directly.\n <br/>\n <br/>\n <strong>\n  MOMENTUM\n </strong>\n <br/>\n Build momentum to do daring jumps between rooftops or stylish slides through tight spaces. Use the new Shift move to get a short burst of acceleration in any direction. For a quick change of plan, tweak any move with Quickturn, a rapid 180 or 90 degree turn.\n <br/>\n <br/>\n <strong>\n  COMBAT\n </strong>\n <br/>\n Deliver devastating full body Heavy Traversal Attacks that throw your opponents stumbling into walls, over railings, and into each other. Use your momentum to flow right through KrugerSec as you string together a series of Light Traversal Attacks, building focus, and keeping speed. Outmaneuver opponents as you Shift behind them for a kick to the back. Or take advantage of a stun with a few rapid punches before Shifting away to avoid retaliation or a counter.\n <br/>\n <br/>\n <strong>\n  GADGETS\n </strong>\n <br/>\n Faith’s running skills, martial arts knowledge, and determination is expanded on with a few pieces of hardware used to traverse the city and rise against the oppression smothering the citizens of Glass.\n <br/>\n <br/>\n <strong>\n  NOTE: ONLINE FEATURES FOR THIS TITLE HAVE BEEN DISCONTINUED.\n </strong>\n</div>\n",

This co-operative action horror FPS takes you and your friends through the cities, swamps and cemeteries of the Deep South, from Savannah to New Orleans across five expansive campaigns.\n <br/>\n <br/>\n You'll play as one of four new survivors armed with a wide and devastating array of classic and upgraded weapons. In addition to firearms, you'll also get a chance to take out some aggression on infected with a variety of carnage-creating melee weapons, from chainsaws to axes and even the deadly frying pan. You'll be putting these weapons to the test against (or playing as in Versus) three horrific and formidable new Special Infected. You'll also encounter five new uncommon common infected, including the terrifying Mudmen.\n <br/>\n <br/>\n Helping to take L4D's frantic, action-packed gameplay to the next level is AI Director 2.0. This improved Director has the ability to procedurally change the weather you'll fight through and the pathways you'll take, in addition to tailoring the enemy population, effects, and sounds to match your performance.

Use your superior mobility (and frequent checkpoints!) to engage in a never-ending dance with death fearlessly.\n <br/>\n <br/>\n Ghostrunner offers a unique single-player experience: fast-paced, violent combat, and an original setting that blends science fiction with post-apocalyptic themes. It tells the story of a world that has already ended and its inhabitants who fight to survive.\n</div>\n",

Freedom of choice and multiple approaches to run your business and deal with pressure are key ingredients in this game.\n </p>\n <p class=\"bb_paragraph\">\n </p>\n <p class=\"bb_paragraph\">\n  <img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1149620/extras/GSS_RENOVATE.gif?t=1729072971\"/>\n  Buy an abandoned gas station in the middle of nowhere and restore it to its former glory. Get rid of debris and broken furniture, fix up the walls, paint and decorate the place to your liking.\n </p>\n <p class=\"bb_paragraph\">\n  Just don’t spend all your cash on the looks right away, you bought a gas station after all. Repair the equipment, buy what can’t be repaired and start serving your customers to earn money for further renovations and improvements.\n </p>\n <p class=\"bb_paragraph\">\n </p>\n <p class=\"bb_paragraph\">\n  <img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1149620/extras/GSS_Expand.gif?t=1729072971\"/>\n  You don’t need to stay small. You can expand your gas station to be able to serve more customers. Also, a gas station is not just about selling fuel. You can expand the array of services that you offer to your customers and thus attract more and more varied customers.\n </p>\n <p class=\"bb_paragraph\">\n  You have various expansion options at your disposal, from smaller ones like providing toilets, a simple shop to complement your income up to big ones like an entire workshop to perform car repairs or even a car wash. There are quite a few choices and most of the expansions can themselves be further expanded upon as well. There is so much you can do here.\n </p>\n <p class=\"bb_paragraph\">\n </p>\n <p class=\"bb_paragraph\">\n  <img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1149620/extras/GSS_customize.gif?t=1729072971\"/>\n  Restoring your gas station is one thing, giving it a personal touch another. The game offers a wide array of options to customize what you have already built and lots of decorations to further enhance the uniqueness of the place. Some decorations can be bought, others have to be acquired during gameplay.\n </p>\n <p class=\"bb_paragraph\">\n  It is not just about making the gas station look nice. The more impressive your gas station looks, the more customers will be attracted.\n </p>\n <p class=\"bb_paragraph\">\n </p>\n <p class=\"bb_paragraph\">\n  <img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1149620/extras/GSS_SERVE.gif?t=1729072971\"/>\n  Serving your customers is key in running your gas station with success. They all expect to have their cars filled up, their shopping done right away and aren’t that patient even when it comes to repairs of their vehicles. You are going to be dealing with some serious time pressure at peak hours and have to schedule various tasks for when it’s less hectic. Proper time management and choosing the right priorities becomes very important when it comes to keeping your customers happy.\n </p>\n <p class=\"bb_paragraph\">\n </p>\n <p class=\"bb_paragraph\">\n  <img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1149620/extras/GSS_Hire.gif?t=1729072971\"/>\n  While you can try, it most cases running a gas station that has been expanded and upgraded offering lots of different services to your customers might be just too much to handle for you alone. This is where employees come into play. You can hire even multiple employees to help you with the various tasks at the gas station. Employees have their own skills and some are better at some tasks than others. Employees also level based on the tasks they perform and become better at them with time.\n </p>\n <p class=\"bb_paragraph\">\n </p>\n <p class=\"bb_paragraph\">\n  <img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1149620/extras/GSS_Stock.gif?t=1729072971\"/>\n  You can’t sell what you don’t have. Keeping track of your stock is important and ordering at the right time for the right price helps to keep profits up. To even better use low price opportunities, you can build a warehouse and expand it to allow for larger storage. Keeping a close eye on your stock is crucial as deliveries take time and you really don’t want to run out of goods to sell, not to mention fuel.\n </p>\n <p class=\"bb_paragraph\">\n </p>\n <p class=\"bb_paragraph\">\n  <img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1149620/extras/GSS_Management.gif?t=1729072971\"/>\n  We created the game so that if you like, you can dive deep into management features and micromanage the living you know what out of it. However, if micromanaging isn’t your cup of tea, we don’t force you to deal with the depths of it. That being said, micromanaging some aspects like supplies or employees can be very rewarding both in terms of finances and fun.\n </p>\n <p class=\"bb_paragraph\">\n </p>\n <h2 class=\"bb_tag\">\n  Key Features\n </h2>\n <ul class=\"bb_ul\">\n  <li>\n   <p class=\"bb_paragraph\">\n    Renovate, run and expand a gas station in the desert.\n   </p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   <p class=\"bb_paragraph\">\n    Build new services like a workshop, shop, warehouse or car wash.\n   </p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   <p class=\"bb_paragraph\">\n    Try to handle everything on your own or hire employees to help out.\n   </p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   <p class=\"bb_paragraph\">\n    Interesting events on top of the normal gameplay.\n   </p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   <p class=\"bb_paragraph\">\n    Lots of customisation and decoration options.\n   </p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   <p class=\"bb_paragraph\">\n    Lots of different customers with varying needs and expectations.\n   </p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   <p class=\"bb_paragraph\">\n    Lots of management options for you to dive into.\n   </p>\n  </li>\n </ul>\n</div>\n",

There are 2 modes available: you can play against Bigfoot controlled by AI, or another player can play as the monster.\n <br/>\n <br/>\n Eyewitnesses often mention its enormous size, incredible strength, and elusiveness. For many years, researchers searched for him, but no one could provide evidence of his existence.\n <br/>\n <br/>\n You are a Bigfoot hunter with an important mission: to put an end to rumours once and for all and prove to yourself that Bigfoot is not just a myth or an invention of the mind... His existence is real, real enough to make your blood run cold. Collect ammunition, study the terrain, and defend yourself from predators. You must use everything available to you to avoid becoming the bottom link of the food chain and to survive the wilderness of the American wildlife sanctuaries.\n <br/>\n <strong>\n  <h2 class=\"bb_tag\">\n   Playing as Hunter\n  </h2>\n </strong>\n <br/>\n <ul class=\"bb_ul\">\n  <li>\n   Gather a team of Bigfoot hunters among your friends or go alone.\n   <br/>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   Arm yourself with the most modern equipment, your only chance to fight off Bigfoot.\n   <br/>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   Use the tools at hand and your own cunning to increase your chances of survival.\n   <br/>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   Remember, there are other predators in dark forests.\n   <br/>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   Engage in a fight with an ancient primate, but remember that sometimes the hunter becomes the hunted.\n  </li>\n </ul>\n <img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/509980/extras/Steam_Hunter_Gif_2.gif?t=1726479351\"/>\n <br/>\n <strong>\n  <h2 class=\"bb_tag\">\n   Playing as Bigfoot\n  </h2>\n </strong>\n <br/>\n <ul class=\"bb_ul\">\n  <li>\n   People have begun to trespass too much; protect your territory from uninvited guests.\n   <br/>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   Get food to become stronger.\n   <br/>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   Use the skills of a predator and unique abilities to hunt people.\n   <br/>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   Darkness is your friend, fear binds the hearts of your enemies.\n   <br/>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   Arrange ambushes and set traps; your victims will not be safe from you.\n   <br/>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   Or just rip out the road sign and charge into battle!\n  </li>\n </ul>\n <img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/509980/extras/Steam_Bigfoot_Gif_5.gif?t=1726479351\"/>\n <br/>\n <strong>\n  <h2 class=\"bb_tag\">\n   Features\n  </h2>\n </strong>\n <br/>\n <ul class=\"bb_ul\">\n  <li>\n   Several US national parks to explore.\n   <br/>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   Single Player mode.\n   <br/>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   Online co-op with up to 4 players in the mode against Bigfoot under the control of AI.\n   <br/>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   Online co-op with up to 5 players in the mode against Bigfoot under the player's control.\n   <br/>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   The game is being developed on Unreal Engine 4.\n  </li>\n </ul>\n <br/>\n Additional information about the game is available at\n <br/>\n <strong>\n  <h2 class=\"bb_tag\">\n   Contact Information\n  </h2>\n </strong>\n <br/>\n <strong>\n  Support:\n  <br/>\n  @mail:\n </strong>\n <a href=\"mailto:support@cyberlightgs.com\">\n  support@cyberlightgs.com\n </a>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n <strong>\n  Cooperation:\n  <br/>\n  @mail:\n </strong>\n <a href=\"mailto:partner@cyberlightgs.com\">\n  partner@cyberlightgs.com\n </a>\n</div>\n",

Resist, and turn darkness against itself. Or embrace corruption, and become ultimate evil.\n <br/>\n <br/>\n From the creators of Divinity: Original Sin 2 comes a next-generation RPG, set in the world of Dungeons &amp; Dragons.\n <br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n <img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1086940/extras/Gather_new.gif?t=1725654125\"/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n Choose from 12 classes and 11 races from the D&amp;D Player's Handbook and create your own identity, or play as an Origin hero with a hand-crafted background. Or tangle with your inner corruption as the Dark Urge, a fully customisable Origin hero with its own unique mechanics and story. Whoever you choose to be, adventure, loot, battle and romance your way across the Forgotten Realms and beyond. Gather your party.

You are turning into a monster, but as the corruption inside you grows, so does your power. That power may help you to survive, but there will be a price to pay, and more than any ability, the bonds of trust that you build within your party could be your greatest strength. Caught in a conflict between devils, deities, and sinister otherworldly forces, you will determine the fate of the Forgotten Realms together.\n <br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n <img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1086940/extras/Next_Gen_new.gif?t=1725654125\"/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n Forged with the new Divinity 4.0 engine, Baldur’s Gate 3 gives you unprecedented freedom to explore, experiment, and interact with a thriving world filled with characters, dangers, and deceit. A grand, cinematic narrative brings you closer to your characters than ever before. From shadow-cursed forests, to the magical caverns of the Underdark, to the sprawling city of Baldur’s Gate itself, your actions define the adventure, but your choices define your legacy. You will be remembered.\n <br/>\n <br/>\n <img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1086940/extras/Experience_Depth.png?t=1725654125\"/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n The Forgotten Realms are a vast, detailed, and diverse world, and there are secrets to be discovered all around you – verticality is a vital part of exploration. Sneak, dip, shove, climb, and jump as you journey from the depths of the Underdark to the glittering rooftops of Baldur’s Gate. Every choice you make drives your story forward, each decision leaving your mark on the world. Define your legacy, nurture relationships and create enemies, and solve problems your way. No two playthroughs will ever be the same.\n <br/>\n <br/>\n <img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1086940/extras/01_Bullets_points.png?t=1725654125\"/>\n <br/>\n <ul class=\"bb_ul\">\n  allows you to combine your forces in combat and simultaneously attack enemies, or split your party to each follow your own quests and agendas.

Their stories intersect with the overarching narrative, and your choices will determine whether those stories end in redemption, salvation, domination, or one of many other outcomes. Play as an Origin and enjoy their stories, or recruit them to fight alongside you.\n </ul>\n <br/>\n <img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1086940/extras/03_Bullets_points.png?t=1725654125\"/>\n <br/>\n <ul class=\"bb_ul\">\n  based on the D&amp;D 5e ruleset.

Enable weighted dice to help sway the battle, or play on Tactician mode for a hardcore experience.\n </ul>\n <br/>\n <img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1086940/extras/04_Bullets_points_Unprecedented.png?t=1725654125\"/>\n <br/>\n <ul class=\"bb_ul\">\n  featuring 31 subraces on top of the 11 races (Human, Githyanki, Half-Orc, Dwarf, Elf, Drow, Tiefling, Halfling, Half Elf, Gnome, Dragonborn), with 46 subclasses branching out of the 12 classes.

Our unique Character Creator features unprecedented depth of character, with reactivity that ensures whomever you are, you will leave a unique legacy behind you, all the way up to Level 12. Over 174 hours of cinematics ensure that no matter the choices you make, the cinematic experience follows your journey – every playthrough, a new cinematic journey.\n </ul>\n <br/>\n <img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1086940/extras/05_Bullets_points_Romances.png?t=1725654125\"/>\n <br/>\n <ul class=\"bb_ul\">\n  With the looming threat of war heading to Baldur’s Gate, and a mind flayer invasion on the horizon, friendships – though not necessary – are bound to be forged on your journey. What becomes of them is up to you, as you enter real, vibrant relationships with those you meet along the way. Each companion has their own moral compass and will react to the choices you make throughout your journey. At what cost will you stick to your ideals? Will you allow love to shape your actions? The relationships made on the road to Baldur’s Gate act as moments of respite at camp as much as they add weight to the many decisions you make on your adventure.\n </ul>\n <br/>\n <img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1086940/extras/06_Bullets_points_Customise.png?t=1725654125\"/>\n <br/>\n <ul class=\"bb_ul\">\n  so that when you hit ‘go live’, your stream isn’t interrupted by a bear, swear, or lack of underwear. Baldur’s Gate 3 has 3 different levels of streamer-friendly customisation. You can disable nudity and explicit content separately (or together), and you can enable Twitch integration to interact directly with your audience, just as we do at our Panel From Hell showcases! You’ll be able to stream Baldur’s Gate 3 without any problems, regardless of how you play, thanks to these options.\n </ul>\n <br/>\n <img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1086940/extras/Final_Image_new.gif?t=1725654125\"/>\n</div>\n",

The highly anticipated title features a new hero, Ezio Auditore da Firenze, a young Italian noble, and a new era, the Renaissance.\n <br/>\n Assassin’s Creed 2 retains the core gameplay experience that made the first opus a resounding success and features new experiences that will surprise and challenge players.\n <br/>\n Assassin’s Creed 2 is an epic story of family, vengeance and conspiracy set in the pristine, yet brutal, backdrop of a Renaissance Italy. Ezio befriends Leonardo da Vinci, takes on Florence’s most powerful families and ventures throughout the canals of Venice where he learns to become a master assassin.\n <br/>\n <ul class=\"bb_ul\">\n  <li>\n   <strong>\n    EZIO, A NEW ASSASSIN FOR A NEW ERA\n   </strong>\n   Ezio Auditore da Firenze is a young Italian noble who will learn the ways of the assassins after his family was betrayed and he looks to seek vengeance. He is a lady’s man, a free soul with panache yet has a very human side to his personality. Through him, you become a master assassin.\n   <br/>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   <strong>\n    RENAISSANCE ITALY\n   </strong>\n   Italy in the 15th century was less a country and more a collection of city-states where families with political and economic strength began to take leadership roles in cities like Florence and Venice. This journey through some of the most beautiful cities in the world takes place in a time in history where culture and art were born alongside some of the most chilling stories of corruption, greed and murder.\n   <br/>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   <strong>\n    A NEW-FOUND FREEDOM\n   </strong>\n   You will be able to perform missions when you want and how you want in this open-ended world that brings back free-running and adds elements such as swimming and even flying to the adventure. The variety in gameplay adds another layer for you to truly play through the game any way you choose.\n   <br/>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   <strong>\n    DYNAMIC CROWD\n   </strong>\n   Discover a living, breathing world where every character is an opportunity for the player. Blending in with the crowd is easier, working with in-game characters provide ample rewards but can also lead to surprising consequences.\n   <br/>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   <strong>\n    BECOME A MASTER ASSASSIN\n   </strong>\n   Perfect your skills to become a master assassin where you brandish new weapons, learn to disarm enemies then use their weapons against them, and assassinate enemies using both hidden blades.\n  </li>\n </ul>\n <br/>\n Please note that as of November 19th, 2018, the online features for this game are no longer supported. The Multiplayer mode / Co-op mode will no longer be accessible.\n</div>\n",
